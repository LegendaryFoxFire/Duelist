.ideas files are working document for each conceptual portion of project to be used for logging issues, extensions, etc

issues:

extensions:
stop using friend struct and just use user one

in Friendslist VM:
/*
 chatgpt came up with this to filter based solely on IDs for efficiency
 func filterFriends(listToBeFiltered: [Friend], friendsToFilter: [Friend]) -> [Friend] {
     let filterIDs = Set(friendsToFilter.map { $0.id })
     return listToBeFiltered.filter { !filterIDs.contains($0.id) }
 }
 */
